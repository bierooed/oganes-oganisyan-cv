      "In this project I occupied the role of Fullstack Frontend Developer. I was creating a site for selling boxes with various souvenirs from Armenia. The purchase process was organized as a subscription, after selecting the desired tariff the user had to answer a few questions so that we could choose a box according to his preferences. The user then had to provide personal information and online payment for their subscription. After payment, the order was added to the database and to Google Spreadsheet for a more convenient interface to work with orders from users.",
